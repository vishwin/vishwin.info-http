Hackathons have become a pretty big part of my life these days. They are like exercise, although mostly mental and actually have the ability to disrupt (or better yet, enhance) the world. The same ground rules apply from the rest of my [Projects](/Projects).

# Schedule

It's summer! I'm probably out riding bikes right now.

## YHack&nbsp;2015

We built a car that picked up and drove shoes to wheelchair level for disabled veterans. It fell apart before it could pick up its first shoe.

## HackUMass&nbsp;2015
_23&ndash;25&nbsp;October 2015, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA_

We made a rogue, drive-away alarm clock.

## HackGT&nbsp;2015
_25&ndash;27&nbsp;September 2015, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA_

We made a coffee machine/mixer featuring three different roasts of ground coffee. Combining them, specifically Dunkin Donuts French Roast, Starbucks Sumatra and Community Coffee New Orleans Blend with Chicory, resulted in the HackGT Special. Drip-type coffee machine controlled by a Flask app.

## MHacks 6
_11&ndash;13&nbsp;September 2015, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI_

We attempted a location via sound triangulation using fast Fourier transform.

## PennApps Fall&nbsp;2015
_4&ndash;6&nbsp;September 2015, University of Pennsylvania (Wells Fargo Center), Philadelphia, PA_

We attempted a drowsy, drunk or otherwise distracted driving detection system with a Leap Motion and Myo among other things.

## HackIllinois&nbsp;2015
_27&nbsp;February&ndash;1&nbsp;March 2015, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL_

**[(Dr Dre's) Mix Machine](https://git.vishwin.info/mixmachinebydre.git/)** ([Devpost](http://devpost.com/software/mix-machine)): a machine learning drink mixer that didn't actually mix drinks due to a lack of a liquid pump available. Used a Raspberry Pi&nbsp;2 and a bunch of servos; apparently the two don't mix too well (pun intended).

## VTHacks&nbsp;2015
_6&ndash;8&nbsp;February 2015, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA_

**[Nightmare](http://devpost.com/software/nightmare-wu3ob)**: I cannot take credit for the final result despite Devpost saying otherwise. Was supposed to be a shooting game, shooting zombunnies to be exact, controlled with Oculus Rift and something else, but the three of us only got to completing the core game engine itself.

## PennApps Winter&nbsp;2015
_16&ndash;18&nbsp;January 2015, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA_

**[CritSim](https://github.com/Knyte/CritSim)** ([Devpost](http://devpost.com/software/critsim)): a cycling sensor framework that transmits handlebar force (turn simulation) and wheel spin (instantaneous velocity and distance pedalled) data using a network daemon; demoed output with a D3.js simulation. Used two Arduinos plus sensors to gather data. Additional inputs, like Sensoria sock, can be added for more data; output can be Oculus/VR and even multiplayer. Licensed under GPLv2.

## YHack&nbsp;2014
_31&nbsp;October&ndash;2&nbsp;November 2014, Yale University, New Haven, CT_

**[YoLunch.me](https://git.vishwin.info/YoLunch.git/)** ([Devpost](http://devpost.com/software/yolunch-me)): a [Yo](http://justyo.co) "service" that uses simple yes/no questions and Facebook integration to help users reconnect with their weaker social ties. Worked on the backend using the Yo API, Flask microframework, Facebook API and MongoDB.

## Unhackathon&nbsp;2014
_20&ndash;21&nbsp;September 2014, Stony Brook University (AlleyNYC), Stony Brook (New York), NY_

**[Coffeestop](https://git.vishwin.info/coffeestop.git/)** ([Devpost](http://devpost.com/software/coffeestop)): a webapp, written in Python using the Flask microframework, Python GPX library, Yelp API, Google Maps API and ordr.in API, to find coffee shops, caf√©s, convenience stores, etc based on inputted GPS track. Optionally, users can order their food/drink for serving just-in-time upon arrival.

## PennApps Spring&nbsp;2014
_14&ndash;16&nbsp;February 2014, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA_

**[Wikitongues](https://git.vishwin.info/flask-wikitongues.git/)** ([Devpost](http://devpost.com/software/wikitongues)): used the Flask microframework, YouTube API and MongoDB to create a purpose-built language video previewer and uploader

## PennApps Fall&nbsp;2013
_6&ndash;8&nbsp;September 2013, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA_

**[MerpIt](https://git.vishwin.info/merpIt.git/)** ([Devpost](http://devpost.com/software/merpit)): used the Flask microframework, Venmo API, MySQL and Twitter Bootstrap for a college student manual labour exchange board

## HackPSU&nbsp;2013
_22&ndash;23&nbsp;March 2013, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA_

This was my first ever hackathon, back when I had no concept of what one was nor the point of them. Being a freshman didn't help either, but the four of us, consisting of a (then-)senior, another ACM member whose identity escapes me and a same-year classmate (who's the president of our ACM chapter as of this writing) still managed to create a half-working PHP something. Apparently everybody who submitted something presented to the whole audience in front; the hackathon at that point was not big enough for (or maybe the organisers never thought of) an expo before final demos.

This also holds the dubious distinction of the only time I've ever attended my own school's hackathon. Each iteration, including this one, has fallen during the collegiate road cycle racing season. I, along with most of the club who did not compete in the highest level of racing, opted to stay home this weekend (the race weekend itself was salvaged last-minute by Bard College hosting only a criterium on their campus), allowing me to attend my first hackathon at home!

There are a few ways to contact me, but email is best.

# Email
I have three email accounts I check on a regular basis, each for different purposes.

There's my Penn State account, which is intended for academic use only. [Initiate academic communication here](/JavaScript){: class="amail" }.

There's an account for business and engineering purposes. This includes most technical communication, job-related communication and other formal business, unless such is academically-related. [Initiate business and engineering communication here](/JavaScript){: class="bmail" }.

And there's my personal account. Everything other than the aforementioned goes here, including most bills. [Personal communication goes here](/JavaScript){: class="pmail" }.

The fourth account, whose address I will not mention here, is used for non-Penn State mailing list and newsgroup communication. Since list archives are pretty much public (and with the numerous anti-harvesting measures taken there already), I prefer to have something to identify myself with other than the email accounts I actually check. Plus it looks cool.

I would prefer that when sending mail, that you send in _plain text_. No, seriously, plain text, with _zero_ formatting like changing colours, text sizes and embedded images (attach those separately please if absolutely necessary); bolds and italics can be expressed just fine in plain text. Even if you think the contents of your email contain solely text, you may still be composing email with HTML in it. Please triple check the format of your message before sending. I won't necessarily bite your head off if you send HTML-formatted mail unintentionally, but HTML email leads me to examine it first for things completely unrelated to your message!

Unlike most Internet users as of this writing, I stay away from managing my email with webmail software (although I have a Google Mail account, I don't read anything using its webmail interface) and stick to good ol' mail clients, specifically [Mozilla Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.org/thunderbird) and [``mutt``](http://www.mutt.org/) on the desktop and [K-9 Mail](https://code.google.com/p/k9mail/) on mobile. So when I need to read my mail in the terminal, and an improperly formatted HTML message comes up, it looks extremely shitty and I most likely won't acknowledge it.

# Social media

# Miscellany
I hang out on [freenode](http://freenode.net/) IRC as my schedule permits.

# Snail mail
My postal address changes quite frequently. But even if it doesn't, I'm not publicly posting it. If you have good cause for needing to know such information, particularly for sending me stuff, [email me](#email).

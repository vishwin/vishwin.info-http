If you're reading this page, you have either blocked, disabled or not supported JavaScript from running. Thank you for not making me feel like a loner in this regard.

But seriously, what probably happened was the result of clicking on one of my email links without JavaScript, which converts the link to this page to the actual email address on the fly. Because email addresses are so easily and quickly harvested for malicious purposes, I have to cloak them even in the source code. So if you really want to email me, you're going to have to type in my email address by hand:

* ``ofni doirep niwhsiv ta eilrahc``{: class="rmail" } for business and engineering purposes
* ``ofni doirep niwhsiv ta niwhsiv``{: class="rmail" } for personal stuff
* ``ofni doirep niwhsiv ta tig``{: class="rmail" } for patches
* ``ude doirep usp ta il tod c``{: class="rmail" } for academic purposes

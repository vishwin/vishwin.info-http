I've written a good amount of code. The stuff I start and work on by myself are by default released under open source licences, so you can inquire, learn and demolish the code as you please (within reason).

# Contributing

Although [the git repos on this here site](http://cgit.vishwin.info) are all mirrored on [my github](https://github.com/vishwin), the github copies are by default read-only. That means I ignore all pull requests, issues, etc. Please [email](/Contact) any issues, requests and patches. I hope to eventually set up a Bugzilla when the time and need arises.

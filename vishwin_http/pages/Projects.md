I've written a good amount of code. The stuff I start and work on by myself are by default released under open source licences, so you can inquire, learn and demolish the code as you please (within reason).

# I created
* **[This here website](http://cgit.vishwin.info/http.git/)**: the HTTP interface; gopher interface is coming soon. Code licensed under MPL&nbsp;2.0.

# Hackathons

Unless agreed to by all team members, these software are not totally open source, although the nature of git implicitly allows others to look at the sources.

* **[CritSim](https://github.com/Knyte/CritSim)** ([PennApps Winter 2015](http://challengepost.com/software/critsim)): a cycling sensor framework that transmits handlebar force (turn simulation) and wheel spin (instantaneous velocity and distance pedalled) data using a network daemon; demoed output with a D3.js simulation. Used two Arduinos plus sensors to gather data. Additional inputs, like Sensoria sock, can be added for more data; output can be Oculus/VR and even multiplayer. Licensed under GPLv2.
* **[YoLunch.me](http://cgit.vishwin.info/YoLunch.git/)** ([YHack 2014](http://challengepost.com/software/yolunch-me)): a [Yo](http://justyo.co) "service" that uses simple yes/no questions and Facebook integration to help users reconnect with their weaker social ties. Worked on the backend using the Yo API, Flask microframework, Facebook API and MongoDB. [Is online](http://yolunch.me) and can be used immediately.
* **[Coffeestop](http://cgit.vishwin.info/coffeestop.git/)** ([Unhackathon 2014](http://challengepost.com/software/coffeestop)): a webapp, written in Python using the Flask microframework, Python GPX library, Yelp API, Google Maps API and ordr.in API, to find coffee shops, caf√©s, convenience stores, etc based on inputted GPS track. Optionally, users can order their food/drink for serving just-in-time upon arrival.
* **[Wikitongues](http://cgit.vishwin.info/flask-wikitongues.git/)** ([PennApps Spring 2014](http://challengepost.com/software/wikitongues)): used the Flask microframework, YouTube API and MongoDB to create a purpose-built language video previewer and uploader
* **[MerpIt](http://cgit.vishwin.info/merpIt.git/)** ([PennApps Fall 2013](http://challengepost.com/software/merpit)): used the Flask microframework, Venmo API, MySQL and Twitter Bootstrap for a college student manual labour exchange board

# Contributing

Although [the git repos on this here site](http://cgit.vishwin.info) are all mirrored on [my github](https://github.com/vishwin), the github copies are by default read-only. That means I ignore all pull requests, issues, etc. Please [email](/Contact) any issues, requests and patches. I hope to eventually set up a Bugzilla when the time and need arises.

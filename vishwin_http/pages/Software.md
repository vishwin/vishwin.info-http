I've written a good amount of code. The stuff I start and work on by myself are by default released under open source licences, so you can inquire, learn and demolish the code as you please (within reason).

# Hackathons

Unless agreed to by all team members, these software are not totally open source, although the nature of git implicitly allows others to look at the sources.

* **[YoLunch.me](http://cgit.vishwin.info/YoLunch.git/)** (YHack 2014): a [Yo](http://justyo.co) service where people in a similar geographical area can request to initiate a meetup. [Is online](http://yolunch.me) and can be used immediately.

# Contributing

Although [the git repos on this here site](http://cgit.vishwin.info) are all mirrored on [my github](https://github.com/vishwin), the github copies are by default read-only. That means I ignore all pull requests, issues, etc. Please [email](/Contact) any issues, requests and patches. I hope to eventually set up a Bugzilla when the time and need arises.

If you haven't caught the drift yet, my name is **Charlie**. I'll show you what I look like if you're nice.

I'm currently an undergraduate student majoring in [computer science at Penn State](http://www.cse.psu.edu/). I've enjoyed tinkering with computers and the whole computing concept since I was five years old, when I started playing with Windows 95 on a mid-90s Toshiba Satellite. Over time, starting from when I taught myself how to mark up web pages and analysing how software runs, I was hooked on the challenge of helping people solve problems (mostly involving computing) and making workflows more efficient. Naturally, this led to me declaring my major as computer science.

Most of my current work is in web development, particularly in front-end and increasingly systems programming-style categories. As a software developer, I have a direct ethical responsibility to make sure users of whatever I create or contribute to can achieve their goals easily, securely and efficiently, and by working on the parts directly visible and clickable to them I am influencing their workflows. Additionally, in the increasing efficiency department, I use systems programming techniques to automate repetitive and systemic tasks to focus human efforts on items needing more human brainpower.

Partly to exhibit my work but mostly to observe and learn about facets of computing not mentioned already, I am part of [Penn State's chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)](http://acm.psu.edu/). In every weekly meeting there is a talk and/or demo, ranging from synchronising Arduinos to music tracks to an introduction on mobile security. I've even done a couple of small demos on occasion. Through ACM, I started participating in hackathons, particularly [PennApps](http://pennapps.com) and [HackPSU](http://www.hackpsu.com/)&nbsp;2013.

In addition to my computing work, I was a mentor and currently a director, specifically webmaster, for the Penn State [Engineering Orientation Network (EON)](http://www.engr.psu.edu/eon/). As an upperclassman engineer, I feel that I also have some responsibility in attracting new students to engineering (and especially computer science) not only because of the demand in the job market but also the endless possibilities of creating new products and protocols and refining existing ones to make positive impacts in the world. Additionally, EON is a vehicle for networking with not only other Penn State engineering students but also companies supportive of EON's mission of engaging and retaining first-year engineering students.

In my other time not spent in front of desktop computer machines (includes laptops!), I ride, race and tinker with bicycles. I am an officer for [Penn State Cycling](http://clubs.psu.edu/up/bike/) and currently maintain its website. Outside of the collegiate scene, I ride and train with many people in the Philadelphia area. Cycling allows me to enjoy the interactions and experiences with other people in a very different manner that requires direct consideration for one another's safety and well-being than just collaboration in software/hardware development.

If you need to contact me, email works for pretty much everything, especially for new acquaintances. I have three accounts for different purposes:

* <a class="bmail" href="/JavaScript">Business and engineering purposes</a>
* <a class="amail" href="/JavaScript">Academic stuff</a>

But please read my [notes on email](/Email) first; they may come in handy.
